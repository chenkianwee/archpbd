# Domain Expertise, Modeling and Simulations

**Domain Expertise**: knowledge and understanding of a specific field, in our case the architectural aspects of buildings

**Model**: abstraction of a system that includes only the features that are of interest and essential to our study. For example heat flows in buildings.

**Simulation**: execution of one or multiple models to achieve a specific objectives such as to predict future system behaviors. For example, we want to know HVAC energy consumption of a building.

## How to use simulation in 3 steps:
1. Be clear why you are running the **simulation**. 
2. Once you know why you are simulating, you need to choose the right **model**. 
3. Knowing the why and choosing the right model requires domain **expertise**.
