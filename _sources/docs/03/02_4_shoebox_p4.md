# Shoebox Model-Part 4: OpenStudio Model Constructions

## Specify the construction of the building envelope
1. Next click on the Spaces tab. Click on the Surfaces tab. We can see that the shoebox model only have 6 surfaces. 4 walls 1 roof and 1 floor. Here you can see the specification of each surface. Lets look at the first row. Space_envelope_0 is:
- Surface Type: Wall
- Construction: nonres_roof
- Outside Boundary Condition: Outdoors
- Outside Boundary Condition: empty

## Edit roof and floor construction
1. Lets look at the nonres_roof construction. Go to the Constructions tab. In the window go to the Constructions tab at the top. Click on the nonres_roof. We can see that it is made up of 3 layers. Outside -> Material 1 -> Material No Mass 1 -> Material 2 -> Inside.

```
<br/><br/> 

2. Lets adjust the construction of the roof for New York climate. Change the name of the construction to 'roof'. Remove Material 2 from the nonres_roof by clicking on the x. Move Material No Mass 1 to the top and Material 1 below it. You can do so by clicking the layers and dragging it to the correct position.

<br/><br/>

3. Go to the Materials tab. Search for 'material no mass 1' and change its name to 'Roof Insulation'. Change the Thermal Resistance to 8.1 m2K/W

<br/><br/>

4. Search for 'material 1' and change the name to 16mm gypsum board. Change the value of the parameters accordingly.
- Roughness: MediumSmooth
- Thickness: 0.016
- Conductivity: 0.16
- Density: 800
- Specific Heat: 1090
- Thermal Absorptance: 0.9
- Solar Absorptance: 0.7
- Visible Asorptance: 0.7

```
<br/><br/>

5. Now if you go back to the Construction tab and look at the roof. You can see the construction properly configured.

```
<br/><br/>

6. Now let's configure the construction for your floor. Search for 'res_roof_floor'. Change the name to 'floor'. Move 'Material Mass 2' to the top and 'Material 3' to the bottom.
```{image} ../../_static/shoebox4/shoe4_7.png

```
<br/><br/>

7. Go to Materials tab and search for 'material mass 2'. Click on the material. Change the name to 'floor insulation'. Change the properties to the following value.
- Roughness: MediumSmooth
- Thermal Resistance: 4.13
- Thermal Absorptance: 0.9
- Solar Absorptance: 0.7
- Visible Absorptance: 0.7
```{image} ../../_static/shoebox4/shoe4_8.png
:width: 100%
:align: center
```
<br/><br/>

8. Next search for 'material 3' in the Materials tab. Change the name to '100mm normal weight concrete floor'. Change the values of the parameters as follows. If you go back to the constructions tab. The floor will be properly configured. 
- Roughness: MediumRough
- Thickness: 0.1
- Conductivity: 2.31
- Density: 2322
- Specific Heat: 832
- Thermal Absorptance: 0.9
- Solar Absorptance: 0.7
- Visible Asorptance: 0.7

## Add a new wall construction
1. Next we need to add a new wall construction. Click on the + button at the Constructions tab. Change the name of the construction to 'wall'. At the right window click on the 'My Model' tab. There are no wall materials yet.

```
<br/><br/>

2. Go to the Materials tab. Click on the 'No Mass Materials'. Click on the '+' button. Name the new material 'wall insulation'. Adjust the value of the properties as follows.
- Roughness: MediumSmooth
- Thermal Resistance: 1.65
- Thermal Absorptance: 0.9
- Solar Absorptance: 0.7
- Visible Absorptance: 0.7

```
<br/><br/>

3. Next we will use a material from the standard material library of OpenStudio Application. Click on 'Library' on the right window. Search for 'stucco'. Drag and drop '1IN Stucco' to the 'Drag from Library' parameter. Pay attention to the arrow to turn to a '+' sign before dropping the material. You will be able to see 1IN stucco in the Materials tab.

```
<br/><br/>

4. Now we can go back to the Constructions tab. Click on the wall construction. Go to the My Model tab at the right window. Search for '1IN Stucco'. Drag and drop the material onto the wall construction. Repeat for the rest of these materials.
- 16mm gypsum board
- wall insulation
- 16mm gypsum board
